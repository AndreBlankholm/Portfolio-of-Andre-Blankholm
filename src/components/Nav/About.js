                <p>Hi My name is Andre Blankholm, I've spent the past 8 years of my career working in the Transpotation field with the state of Minnesota and one day I decided to make steps to pursue my passion for learning coding and trying to make it a career . I am  currently fresh off a 6 month bootcamp and loving it! I have worked with Vanilla JS, Node.js, Express.js,
                    TDD, Databases and now React. Constructive criticism is welcome and thanks again for your time.</p>
